# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Assignment

This read-me describes the  data and overview of the transformations and actions that have been applied to the data set in the process of creating a tidy data set.

## The Data Source

[Original Data Source](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

[Original Description of the Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attribute Information

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Transformation Details

There are 5 activities that are being undertaken:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Label the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

## How run_analysis.R executes the above transformations

### Libraries Used
The libraries used in the R Script are `data.table` and `dplyr` and the library is loaded at the commencement of the script

### Loading of Supporting Metadata
The metadata is loaded into variables `FeatureNames` and `ActivityLabels` and are referenced later in the script to update the data labels

### Reading Training and Test Data
The data for the training and test sets are split up into three specific sections being subject, activity and features.  Each of these are in different folders and files.

The data is then loaded into files for each of the sections based on Training and Test and then this is merged into a single  data file for each section.

In the merged file the columns are named using the meta data that was previously loaded and is contained in the variable `FeatureNames` and merged into a single file named `CompleteData`

### Extract measurement for Means and Standard Deviation
The use of the `grep` command is used to filter columns that contain Mean or Std.  The `extractedData` variable is defined that consists of `CompleteData` and subset using the variable `filteredCols’

### Assigning Descriptive Names
Through the use of the `gsub` command to replace assigned names with more descriptive and friendly names to make the data set easy to use and in preparation for exporting as a tidy data set.

### Export data to new Data Set

A variable is created called `tidyData` as a data set with average for each activity and subject. Then the entries are ordered and then written out as data file Tidy.txt that contains the processed data.
